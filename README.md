# 🚀 Cross-Border AI-Powered Payments

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to reduce high FX fees and optimize international payments using **AI + Stablecoins (USDC)**. It helps businesses save time and money by selecting the best payment method (crypto vs. traditional banking) based on fees, speed, and recipient preferences.

---

## 🛑 Problem
Businesses lose money and time when sending international payments:

- **High FX Fees**: Banks & payment providers charge **3-5%** in conversion fees.
- **Slow Settlements**: Wire transfers take **3-5 days** to process.
- **Lack of Crypto Awareness**: Many businesses don’t realize that their vendors already accept **USDC**, which is cheaper and instant.

### Example Scenario
A global UI/UX agency, **Global Designs**, pays contractors in **12 countries**.

- They spend **$4,300/month** on wire transfer and FX fees.
- A recent **$8,500 payment** to Singapore lost **$340 in fees** and took **4 days** to arrive.
- **80% of their contractors already accept USDC**, but they don’t know!

## ✅ Solution: AI-Powered Payment Optimizer
### **Key Features**
1️⃣ **Detects vendors that accept USDC** and sends payments instantly.
2️⃣ **Encourages non-crypto vendors** to open a Payman account for stablecoin transfers.
3️⃣ **Chooses the best payment method** (Crypto vs. Traditional Bank) based on fees, speed, and recipient preferences.

### **How It Works**
1. **User Inputs Payment Details**
   - Amount, currency, recipient, country, preferred method (if any).

2. **AI Determines the Best Payment Route**
   - Checks if the recipient accepts **USDC/stablecoins**.
   - Compares **FX fees** vs. **stablecoin transaction costs**.
   - Suggests **crypto or traditional bank transfer** for optimal savings.

3. **AI Executes Payment**
   - If the vendor accepts **USDC**, send payment instantly via blockchain.
   - If not, suggest creating a **Payman account** to receive stablecoins.
   - If neither is an option, default to **a traditional bank transfer**.
